        <p><em>A little about me</em></p>
        <p>I am a creative technology and design student at CU Boulder. I am originally from Las Vegas but I much prefer the snow to the heat! I have more hobbies than I have time for including; drawing, cooking, baking, crocheting and so much more.</p>

        <h2>My Goals For Web</h2>
        <p>My goals for web are to become comfortable with html  coding and to learn about UI/UX. I would also like to build a portfolio to showcase some of the work I have made. Overall I just want to learn as much as I can as these are very new skills for me. </p>
